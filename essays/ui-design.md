Bootstrap 5 is most likely one of the most frustrating things that I have had to learn throughout my life. I can look at all the documentation that I want or look at as many examples as I think I need but somehow when I want to implement it in a project of my own it doesn’t go the way that I think it would. For example, there have been a handful of times when I am trying to center the items of a navbar so I think “Oh I can just justify-content-center” and then I put it in the class section, and nothing changes, and the navbar is just stuck hugging the left side of my screen. This is very odd to me because I will have the same div and instead of center I will justify the content to the beginning or end and it will work as expected. I’m not entirely sure why this happens I can’t find anything in the documentation that would explain the issue I am having with this. Later on, I learned of “mx-auto” which seems to work most of the time as instead of just having the content in the center it sets the margins so that the content is centered but it bugs me that justify-content-center doesn’t work for me.
I’m sure that there are many useful aspects of Bootstrap 5 and the reason why I don’t like it so much is due to my inexperience as opposed to actual flaws in itself but I feel like it shouldn’t be this hard to understand. For many assignments, I have been made to replicate the design of some websites, multiple random ones, and one that I chose myself. It would be an understatement to say that I barely understood what was going on in these assignments, it felt more like I had no idea what was going on and instead was just copying the things that I saw from the solutions from previous assignments into the future ones and prayed that they would somehow look like the website I was trying to replicate. I also found it very confusing how perfect the replications needed to be, like did we need the dropdown menus to work and the buttons to be clickable?
