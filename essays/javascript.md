When first hearing about Javascript the first question that I had was “Is it just the same as Java?”. I quickly learned that they were not quite the same as I went through Javascript exercises that introduced me to the differences between them. This was quite troubling for me as although I am a bit familiar with Java, Javascript would be difficult for me to understand and learn if they differed greatly. However, I found that although they differ, Javascript may be not all too difficult to learn excluding some concepts that I have a hard time grasping as it doesn’t require some things Java does. One example of this is that in Javascript you don’t have to declare the type of your variable whereas in Java you have to make certain specifications such as int or string depending on what type you want. 



But as I mentioned earlier some concepts got me quite confused when I first tried looking at them and I am still not 100% comfortable with them. One such concept is object properties, at first the concept seemed simple enough but I needed to remember how to correctly write the code to assign properties to objects and things got even more confusing for me as they introduced arrays as properties as well as nested properties. Beyond just writing the code to assign properties to objects, accessing these properties in the code was also a struggle for me. It took me around 10-20 minutes to understand how to access properties inside of a nested array and even now if I was asked to do it I would probably have to seek help from the internet or look back at the exercise. 



So what do I think about Javascript? I appreciate the more relaxed style of Javascript but also understand how that makes it useful in different situations than Java. Right now I think I don’t have enough practice with Javascript to make a definitive decision but I believe that Javascript will be a very effective tool when working in software engineering and web development. With these thoughts in mind, I find athletic software engineering to be a useful way of practicing my skills as while I practice Javascript I will find out for myself if I will continue to appreciate Javascript as a language for software engineering. And while having to practice every day will be quite stressful for me I think it will be enjoyable as I have been wanting to strengthen my skills in software engineering and overall programming.
