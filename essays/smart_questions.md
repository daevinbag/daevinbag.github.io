#### What is a Smart Question and why should I care?:


 In "[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)" Eric Raymond describes smart questions in the context of interaction with the open source community. It covers the guidelines on how and when to ask questions on certain forums such as StackOverflow which I will use as an example later on. It covers things such as how you should format your title on the forums, what forums you should post to, what the contents of your post should look like, and most importantly when to post. I say that knowing when to post is the most important because if your question is easily answered by a quick Google search then the people on the forums may not be very happy to help you. But other than that when you do have something to post about Eric Raymond talks about how an object-deviation style subject line is the best where the object is your circumstances and the deviation is the issue. And while in some cases it may be I also think that there are exceptions to this rule where a bit more descriptiveness in the title may be necessary, or just some cases where this style of subject line doesn’t fit. So overall I wouldn’t be afraid to stray away from that style of subject line if the situation calls for it. But one very important thing that I think everyone should know about from this writing is the actual body of the post. And basically, it’s to get rid of all the fluff on your post. Don’t include huge amounts of code unless completely necessary, don’t include your guesses as to the solution to your problem, don’t add extra words of apology and anything else that might seem unnecessary. Cutting out all the unnecessary parts makes your post easier to read and will prevent deterring reading due to the sheer size of your post.


#### A "Smart Question":


"[What Java function can I use on macOS to play a proper alert sound upon the proper device, at the proper volume?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77869820/what-java-function-can-i-use-on-macos-to-play-a-proper-alert-sound-upon-the-prop)"

In this post, the user is wondering what Java function they could use on macOS to have the user alert sound play at their chosen alert volume. This much is very clear by their title which is one of the good parts of this post. The title gives a very clear description of what they want using what programming language and what OS. Then when you click on the post you get a very good idea of what exactly they are envisioning here as they go through what specific setting they want the sounds to play with respect to and give an example of what they want to happen ideally. And then he also ends it off well not using a yes or no question asking “How can I do this?” One other thing that I think is good about this post is that it doesn’t feel like they’re just asking for you to do it for them or like they’re coming here after their first attempt at this task. They state in their post that there are many other things they could try to play the alert sound but that none of them fit their needs, implying that they did try some other methods before coming here. Also, instead of just showing them some code and asking them “Code this so that the alerts play with respect to my alert sound and volume” they ask just about the function that they could use so they can try and use it themselves. To me, these aspects of the post give it more of a feeling that they are asking this question because they genuinely want to know and couldn’t find any other solution online instead of just wanting this answer because they couldn’t bother to look it up or try anything for themselves.

#### A Not-So-Smart Question:

"[i can't to fix CORS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77175715/i-cant-to-fix-cors)"

In short, the original poster asks about why they are getting a certain error involving CORS. And to begin with, you wouldn’t really be able to extract much info just from the subject line alone as I’m not sure many people would understand what “i can’t to fix CORS” is meant to mean exactly and a more understandable title that is closer to the contents of the error message such as “Error: Blocked by CORS policy” could be better. Therefore this post is guaranteed not to get as much attention even if it were to be a meaningful and thought-provoking question because the title doesn’t suggest as much. But, when you look at the post you realize that the amount of thought put into the title was most likely about the same amount of thought put into the post. The poster just slapped their error message on there and then pasted their code. They provided very little context on what it is exactly that they were asking and overall they didn’t have much to say other than the text that was the error message and their code. Another thing about this question is that when I search it up on Google I appear to find another thread similar to this one making it seem as though this person didn’t do their research before making this post. Overall, this post breaks many of the rules of creating a smart question and they could have saved themselves the trouble with a quick Google search.
