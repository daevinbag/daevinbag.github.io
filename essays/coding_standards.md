Many people would agree that coding standards are essential when writing code. Whether it’s because it helps with readability for people who you may be sharing your code with, for the organization of the code for yourself, or even just as a way to ensure that your code will work, coding standards hold many different practical uses in the creation of programs. So by showing all the benefits of coding standards surely everyone codes with perfect readability and coding standards so that everything is nice and organized and nice for others to read, right? For many people, the answer to this question is no, and I don’t blame them. 
#### My initial thoughts:
When using things like IntelliJ set up with certain coding standards, it becomes much easier for me to see visually what lines of code have issues and will often have a comment that lets me know generally what the problem is allowing me to fix it. But still, I can’t help but feel that some of the things that it wants me to do is a little silly, or just overall a waste of time. For example, if I am using the Underscore library in my code (because I love functional programming) and I want to use the _.filter function and create a function within it to filter my elements, the ESLint coding standards require me to add a space after the word “function” and after the first curly brace and before the last one in my return statement. I often forget to do these things and find it very tedious to go back and add it for a very tiny difference in my code that in my opinion doesn’t help with readability in a significant way. I only really memorized this coding standard recently, so when I was first introduced to JSLint and it was highlighting my code with an error I wondered where the error was because the red underline for the parenthesis and the curly brackets were so small that I couldn’t exactly tell where the issue was. So every time I would forget about this tedious detail, I would have to go find the tiny problem area and hover over it for it to tell me to add one singular space.
#### But is it all bad
I may complain about all the tedious little details that coding standards have, but it’s not all tedious and/or useless. It has had many comments about my code that have either helped the readability of it significantly or even helped me realize that I had an error in my code. For example, while I was testing my code it helped point out to me that a function that I was trying to log in the console didn’t exist because I misspelled it and if I didn’t have something to point it out to me, I probably wouldn’t have found it for a while. It also enforces the use of semicolons after each line, which was something that I thought was weird that we didn’t use anymore so if you are someone who likes having the semicolons to indicate the end of a line then coding standards are for you. Learning code with an IDE to enforce coding standards on you also seems like a very effective way of learning to program using a given language. Even if you are skilled in a different language, there are small differences between each one so being taught the general standard practices of a language by its coding standards can be an effective way to beat it into your brain until you get it right. 
#### So what do I really think?
I think that if ultra-clear readability is your focus then coding standards are for you. Whether you are learning the language for the first time or are an experienced user who just hasn’t been following the coding standards until now, it probably would be a good idea to start learning some coding standards. Although it may be tedious, if you keep making the same mistake you are probably going to one day learn from it and then you won’t have to worry about solving it anymore. I feel like I never really properly learned the correct way to code using coding standards in any language so it has been a bit tough for me to memorize some of the small details but overall it is a very useful skill for any programmer to have.
