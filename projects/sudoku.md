This is a sudoku solver that I made for my ICS 211 class. You can input a sudoku puzzle as a 2D array and as long as it is solvable it will give you the solution. 

It works using recursion as it will call a function to fill the squares and then check if it is correct using another function and if not it will call back the function to fill the squares but in a different way to 
find the correct solution. This assignment was very interesting and helped me learn about recursion.

Example of it solving a sudoku puzzle:
